Network Socket test plan
========================

This is a test plan for the Mbed OS Socket API. This describes all test
cases and their intended behaviors. When an API document is not clear, use
this as a reference for implementing correct behavior.

**NOTE:** Because testing is a moving target, this test plan might define more test cases than Mbed OS
implements. Refer to [test case priorities](#test-case-priorities) for a list of test cases that the target must pass to be compliant with the Mbed OS socket API.


Target API
----------

The target for this plan is to test:

-   [Socket](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/blob/master/features/netsocket/Socket.h).
-   [UDPSocket](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/blob/master/features/netsocket/UDPSocket.h).
-   [TCPSocket](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/blob/master/features/netsocket/TCPSocket.h).
-   [TCPServer](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/blob/master/features/netsocket/TCPServer.h).

Reference documentation: https://os.mbed.com/docs/latest/reference/network-socket.html

Tools to use
----------------

-   Mbed OS.
-   Standard Mbed OS development tools as described in https://os.mbed.com/docs/latest/tools/index.html.
-   Test server.

These test cases themselves do not require any special tooling, other than
the test server described in "Test environment" chapter.

Test environment
----------------

As a general guideline, network connectivity with public Internet access
is required. This satisfies Socket tests, but specific connectivity
methods might require some extra configuration or devices within the
network.

The test environment consist of DUTs, network connection and the test
server. Arm provides a public test server, but it can be installed locally
as well, if an isolated test environment is required.

### Public test server

Address: `echo.mbedcloudtesting.com`

Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are available from a public DNS service:

```.sh
$ host echo.mbedcloudtesting.com
echo.mbedcloudtesting.com has address 52.215.34.155
echo.mbedcloudtesting.com has IPv6 address 2a05:d018:21f:3800:8584:60f8:bc9f:e614
```

**Open services in the test server**

-   Echo protocol, [RFC 862](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc862) is
    enabled in both TCP and UDP. Port 7.
-   Discard protocol, [RFC 863](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc863) is
    enabled in both TCP and UDP. Port 9.
-   Character generator protocol, [RFC 864](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc864) is
    enabled in both TCP and UDP. Port 19. Output pattern should follow
    the proposed example pattern in RFC.
-   Daytime protocol, [RFC 867](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc867) in
    both TCP and UDP. Port 13.
-   Time protocol, [RFC 868](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc868) in
    both TCP and UDP. Port 37.

Configure the firewall to allow this traffic to access the test server.

**Example configuration for Debian/Ubuntu Linux**

These services are available on many operating systems, and installing them is out of
scope of this document. Below is an
example of how to install these services into a Debian/Ubuntu based Linux distribution
using standard Inet Daemon:

```.sh
$ sudo apt install inetutils-inetd
$ nano /etc/inetd.conf
```

Enable following services from /etc/inetd.conf:

```
#:INTERNAL: Internal services
discard     stream  tcp6    nowait  root    internal
discard     dgram   udp6    wait    root    internal
echo        stream  tcp6    nowait  root    internal
echo        dgram   udp6    wait    root    internal
chargen     stream  tcp6    nowait  root    internal
chargen     dgram   udp6    wait    root    internal
daytime     stream  tcp6    nowait  root    internal
time        stream  tcp6    nowait  root    internal
```

**Testing the connectivity**

You can connect to the test server with an NMAP tool like this:

```.sh
$ nmap -sT -p7,9,13,37 echo.mbedcloudtesting.com

Starting Nmap 7.12 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2018-04-05 16:17 EEST

```

### Ethernet test environment

![Ethernet](eth_environment.png)

The Ethernet test environment consists of devices, an ethernet switch and an optional
firewall that allows connecting to the Echo server.

### Wi-Fi test environment

![Wi-Fi](wifi_environment.png)

The Wi-Fi test environment is equivalent to the Ethernet test environment, except that the
Wi-Fi test environment has two separate access points or one with dual SSID. Connectivity to
echo server is required, but it can be hosted locally, as specified in
the Ethernet environment.

Test case priorities
--------------------

Please refer to the following table for priorities of test cases. Priorities
are labeled as MUST and SHOULD. MUST means this is a requirement and
therefore mandatory to pass the test. SHOULD means it is recommended to
pass the test if the driver implements the feature in question.

Building test binaries
--------------------------

For testing the board and driver, test against the Mbed OS
master branch to get the most recent, up-to-date test cases and drivers.

To create a build environment:

```.sh
mbed new network_test
cd network_test
cd mbed-os
git checkout master
cd ..
```

Also, building socket test cases requires a special macro to
enable all tests, so create an `mbed_app.json` file with the following
content at minimum:

```
{
    "config": {
        "echo-server-addr" : {
            "help" : "IP address of echo server",
            "value" : "\"echo.mbedcloudtesting.com\""
        },
        "echo-server-port" : {
            "help" : "Port of echo server",
            "value" : "7"
        }
        "echo-server-discard-port" : {
            "help" : "Discard port of echo server",
            "value" : "9"
        }
    }
}
```

Wi-Fi tests require some more configuration, so for Wi-Fi purposes,
the `mbed_app.json` might look like this:

```
{
    "config": {
        "wifi-secure-ssid": {
            "help": "WiFi SSID for WPA2 secured network",
            "value": "\"test-network\""
        },
        "wifi-unsecure-ssid": {
            "help": "WiFi SSID for unsecure netwrok",
            "value": "\"unsecure-test-net\""
        },
        "wifi-password": {
            "help": "WiFi Password",
            "value": "\"password\""
        },
        "wifi-secure-protocol": {
            "help": "WiFi security protocol, valid values are WEP, WPA, WPA2, WPA_WPA2",
            "value": "\"WPA2\""
        },
        "wifi-ch-secure": {
            "help": "Channel number of secure SSID",
            "value": 6
        },
        "wifi-ch-unsecure": {
            "help": "Channel number of unsecure SSID",
            "value": 6
        },
        "ap-mac-secure": {
            "help": "BSSID of secure AP in form of AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF",
            "value": "\"58:8b:f3:99:f2:9c\""
        },
        "ap-mac-unsecure": {
            "help": "BSSID of unsecure AP in form of \"AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF\"",
            "value": "\"58:8b:f3:99:c2:08\""
        },
        "max-scan-size": {
            "help": "How many networks may appear in Wifi scan result",
            "value": 30
        },
        "echo-server-addr" : {
            "help" : "IP address of echo server",
            "value" : "\"echo.mbedcloudtesting.com\""
        },
        "echo-server-port" : {
            "help" : "Port of echo server",
            "value" : "7"
        }
    },
    "target_overrides": {
        "*": {
            "target.network-default-interface-type": "WIFI",
            "nsapi.default-wifi-ssid": "\"WIFI_SSID\"",
            "nsapi.default-wifi-password": "\"WIFI_PASSWORD\"",
            "nsapi.default-wifi-security": "WPA_WPA2"
        }
    }
}
```
See `mbed-os/tools/test_configs` folder for examples.

Now build test binaries:

```.sh
mbed test --compile -t <toolchain> -m <target> -n mbed-os-tests-network-*,mbed-os-tests-netsocket*
```

Running tests
-------------

When device is connected to network, or in case of wireless device near
the access point.

```.sh
mbed test -n mbed-os-tests-network-*,mbed-os-tests-netsocket*
```

Test cases for Socket class
---------------------------

These test are equal for UDPSocket and TCPSocket but are described here
because of identical API and behaviour. Socket class is abstract so it
cannot be instantiated, therefore these test cases are implemented using
both TCPSocket and UDPSocket.

4.  Repeat 1000 times.

**Expected result:**

`Socket::open()` should always return NSAPI_ERROR_OK



### SOCKET_OPEN_LIMIT
